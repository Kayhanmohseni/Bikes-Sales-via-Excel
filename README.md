### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into bike sales. 
By analyzing the data provided, we seek to find patterns between the range of survey takers
looking to buy a bike based on gender, income, commute distance, and more. 

### Data Sources

Bike Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Sales.csv" file, 
containing information about the survey takers.

### Data Cleaning

In the initial data preparation phase which was all done in Microsoft Excel, I performed the following tasks: 
1. Removed all duplicates
2. Edited names using UPPER, LOWER, or Proper function
3. Used filter to look for spelling errors
4. Trimmed white spaces using TRIM function
5. Fixed issues with numerical data such as currency and dates
6. Created a new column containing age groups

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring layoff data to answer key questions below:

- What was the average income per bike purchase of a male and female?
- Does commute distance impact whether or not someone looks into buying a bike? 
- What age bracket was considering buying a bike the most?

### Results

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. Males with an average income of $60,124 or higher are more likely to buy a bike.
   Females with an average income of $55,774 or higher are more likely to buy a bike.
2. The shorter the commute the higher chance of someone looking into buying a bike.
3. The age bracket classified as "middle age" (31-54)
